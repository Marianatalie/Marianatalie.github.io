            <p>A large portion of who I am comes down to what I do and that trickles down to the activities I indulge in as pastimes. These 
                are just amongst the few things I enjoy taking part in:

        <div id="point-1">
            <li class="headings">Coding</li>
            <p>Needless to say, coding is one of my major enjoyable pastimes. It was one of those activities that was a passion of mine that met work to become my greatest hobby.
                 It manages to equally combine a variety of attributes I look for such as learning, innovation, challenge and creation.

        <div  id="point-2">
            <li class="headings">Exercising</li>
            <p>To begin with, I absolutely relish exercising, specifically in the gym. Just the sight of a pair of 5 kg dumbbells is enough
                to get me going. I like challenging my body to various degrees such as strength and endurance; something enabled through 
                weight training.

        <div id="point-3">
            <li class="headings">Watching social commentaries on contemporary socio-political issues</li>
            <p>I like gathering various schools of thoughts so as to challenge my own and observe trends in society. Each scintillating 
               conversation brings up a new way that I can challenge my thought as well as helps in interacting and networking with others.

            <li class="headings">Sewing</li>
            <p>I also enjoy sewing which I picked up last year (2020). There’s nothing better than curating a perfectly custom-fitted outfit 
                for yourself, I recently discovered. It utilizes the same attributes as coding, which are creativity, innovation, skill 
                and creation. This makes it all the more enjoyable.

        <div id="point-5">
            <li class="headings">Cooking</li>
            <p>I have also come to enjoy cooking at rather “interesting” hours as my family would say - but discovering new recipes is a key interest of mine. Being able to engage my taste buds with 
                savoury delicacies obtained from recipes all over the world, is just the added cherry on top.

        <div id="point-6">
            <li class="headings">Spending time with family</li>
            <p>I believe I would not be the person I am today if it were not for my family. They've helped mold me for the better and continue to do so
                 as I get older. I regard them as my first soulmates as I believe our souls were destined to come together and journey through life together. This is quite the Shakesperian way of saying,
                "I enjoy spending time with my family".
