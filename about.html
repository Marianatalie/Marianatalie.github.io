            <h3>I'd like to think of my background as a system of gears working together to execute a function.</h3>
            <p>I just finished my Bachelors in Mechatronic Engineering at University of Glasgow.The course is an interdiscplinary branch that 
                studies a combination of mechanical, electrical and software engineering. Here, I learned the basics of low-level coding to 
                control industrial machines setup for various uses. Amongst the programming languages I encountered was C and MATLAB. I also learned the ropes of embedded programming, robotics and control.
                This served as the basis for my entry into the software engineering and development space, as well as the first gear rotating in the system.
            </p>
                 
            <p>From this, the next gear kept the momentum going leading to my enrollment for a unit being offered by an orgnization known as CodeFirstGirls where I was introduced to the 
                basics of using HTML and CSS for frontend web development. In my third year, I had a unit in software engineering which 
                prompted me to start self-learning Python on Udemy.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, for my final year project, I used the aforementioned skills I had acquired in the development and design of the 
                user interface for a computer-aided manufacturing software. The application was made to ensure a user-friendly program for 
                the generation of meshes of engineering materials and further reinforced my "system's" efficiency of heading into software. 
            </p>
            <p> Currently, I am registered for a class in SQL and data programming being offered by CodeFirstGirls, where I am gaining 
                skills in dealing with databases and their management of big data. I am also enrolled in a bootcamp known as Umuzi. It 
                helps in my learning of all the ins and outs of web development such as proper coding practices, test driven development, 
                object oriented programming etc. I have also learned the basics of a new language, JavaScript, which is an added bonus.I 
                look forward to learning more and using this knowledge for the creation of even more complex and impactful projects. The goal remains
                keeping the momentum and efficiency of this system going long enough to discover its final function.
