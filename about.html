          I really enjoy studying a variety of subjects to understand how the
          world works in its current state and the reasons for it. The topics
          span from technology and engineering to entrepreneurship and
          philosophy. I relish creating products such as software that are
          impactful to society and help solve specific societal issues.

          I'd like to think of my background as a system of gears working
          together to execute a function.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I just finished my Bachelors in Mechatronic Engineering at University
          of Glasgow.The course is an interdiscplinary branch that studies a
          combination of mechanical, electrical and software engineering. Here,
          I learned the basics of low-level coding to control industrial
          machines setup for various uses. Amongst the programming languages I
          encountered was C and MATLAB. I also learned the ropes of embedded
          programming, robotics and control. This served as the basis for my
          entry into the software engineering and development space, as well as
          the first gear rotating in the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          From this, the next gear kept the momentum going leading to my
          enrollment for a unit being offered by an orgnization known as
          CodeFirstGirls where I was introduced to the basics of using HTML and
          CSS for frontend web development. In my third year, I had a unit in
          software engineering which prompted me to start self-learning Python
          on Udemy.

          Moreover, for my final year project, I used the aforementioned skills
          I had acquired in the development and design of the user interface for
          a computer-aided manufacturing software. The application was made to
          ensure a user-friendly program for the generation of meshes of
          engineering materials and further reinforced my "system's" efficiency
          of heading into software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am registered for a class in SQL and data programming
          being offered by CodeFirstGirls, where I am gaining skills in dealing
          with databases and their management of big data. I am also enrolled in
          a bootcamp known as Umuzi. It helps in my learning of all the ins and
          outs of web development such as proper coding practices, test driven
          development, object oriented programming etc. I have also learned the
          basics of a new language, JavaScript, which is an added bonus.I look
          forward to learning more and using this knowledge for the creation of
          even more complex and impactful projects. The goal remains keeping the
          momentum and efficiency of this system going long enough to discover
          its final function.
